        Phoenix means fire bird and most people said pheonix isn't real. Sadly
        it's true but some people still believe phoenix is real. why i write
        about phoenix isn't real cause internet said phoenix isn't real. i don't
        have much information about phoenix because you know phoenix isn't real
        The phoenix is a part of ancient Greek folklore, a giant bird associated
        with the sun. It's said to have lived for 500 years before dying and
        being born again, though there's disagreement about whether that rebirth
        occurs in an explosion of flames or after regular decomposition. So you
        can't find any phoenix in the whole world. Because i said it around
        almost 10 times. But I'm lying I say phoenix is not real between 4 to 6
        times. In Mongolia this lying called 'davslah'. that means you lie some
        information like information said its 4 dollars and you said its between
        6 dollars to 10. If you read this whole time you just waste your time
        just tap the link and read more than my information. You just found more
        information from this site
